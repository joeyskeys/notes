    "## Main structure\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. 2012 Disney BRDF : mix($BSDF_{dielectric}$, $BRDF_{metallic}$, $P_{metallic}$)\n",
    " 2. 2015 Extended BSDF : mix(mix($BSDF_{dielectric}$ + $BSSRDF$, $BSDF_{specular}$, $P_{spec_trans}$), $BRDF_{metallic}$, $P_{metallic}$)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Specular lobe\n",
    "\n",
    "Two specular lobes are included:\n",
    " 1. Main microfacet specular lobe, in 2012 BRDF it's a specular BRDF, in 2015 BSDF it combinded with BTDF, check [Bruce Walter 2007].\n",
    " 2. Secondary specular as clearcoat, only contributing to reflection.\n",
    " \n",
    "And in the extended BSDF, surface absorption and volumetric absorption are added:\n",
    " 1. surface absorption : \"we multiply the refraction result by the square root of the surface color\", how to get the square root of a color?\n",
    " 2. \"we apply volumetric absorption based on the length of refracted paths through the solid\", according to Beer-Lambert law, $T = e^{-\\sigma_\\alpha d}$, transmittance color is used as parameter, we calculate $\\sigma_\\alpha = -(\\log{T})/d$\n",
    " \n",
    "## Diffuse lobe\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012 BRDF, diffuse lobe adds a Fresnel factor : $(1 - F(\\theta_l))(1 - F(\\theta_d))$, where $F(\\theta)$ is the fresnel factor for reflection.\n",
    "And diffuse lobe is modeled like :\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_d = \\frac{baseColor}{\\pi} (1 + (F_{D90} - 1)(1 - \\cos{\\theta_l})^5)(1 + (F_{D90} - 1)(1 - \\cos{\\theta_v})^5)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{D90} = 0.5 + 2 * roughenss * \\cos^2{\\theta_d}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015 BSDF, diffuse lobe is refactored into directional microfacet effects and non-directional subsurface effects, then the non-directional part can either be a diffusion model or a volumetric scattering model.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_d = f_{lambert}(1 - 0.5F_L)(1 - 0.5F_V) + f_{retro-reflection}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{lambert} = \\frac{baseColor}{\\pi}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{retro_reflection} = \\frac{baseColor}{\\pi} R_R (F_L + F_V + F_L F_V(R_R - 1))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_L = (1 - \\cos{\\theta_l})^5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_V = (1 - \\cos{\\theta_v})^5\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sheen lobe\n",
    "\n",
    "Sheen is a additive part of diffuse lobe. Tinted towards baseColor by sheenTint, has the form of $sheen * (1 - \\cos{\\theta_d})^5$.\n",
    "According the implementations, sheen part is a seperate diffuse lobe. To be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subsurface\n",
    " 1. diffussion profile\n",
    " 2. path traced subsurface scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thin surface\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Explains parameter diffTrans and specTrans\n",
    " 2. Transmissive blurring caused by refraction can be approximated by scaling the roughenss parameter by $0.65\\eta - 0.35$\n",
